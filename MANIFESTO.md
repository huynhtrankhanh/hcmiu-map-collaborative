# Basic Tenets
* The license of this project is 0BSD
* Every feature has to be documented in /docs. Every feature has to be tested. We need both backend API tests and end-to-end Puppeteer tests.
* The database to be used is ArangoDB.
# Current Task
* There is a ZIP file containing the code of the former project. Extract it, and replace all files of the current repository with the files in the ZIP file, except MANIFESTO.md.
* From this solid foundation, we are to make HCMIU Map the platform for all things HCMIU.
* Login/Signup:
  * All content is accessible even when the user is not logged in.
  * Logging in is required in order to create content.
  * Database stores username and hashed password. Password must be hashed with sodium.crypto_pwhash on client side and SHA256 on server side. Both hashes must be randomly salted. The database must store the salt. The salt is generated by the server.
* User generated content:
  * All changes to content must be reflected immediately on the user interface. This requires the use of WebSockets.
  * **Entity:**
    * Every room in the HCMIU Map is an entity. Every user is an entity. Even the stairs are entities.
    * HCMIU Map users are talkative.
